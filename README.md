# Spell Check with LibreOffice in headless mode

This is an example of how to use LibreOffice in headless mode, and through 
its API's (see UNO for more details) use the spell checker in your Locale. 

The headless mode depends on a jar (bootstrapconnector) whose source code 
can be found at https://github.com/kinow/bootstrapconnector
